## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

 When I first signed up for the class I knew absolute zero about coding. In my mind I saw myself in a dark room typing code all day. But i'm realizing that's not really what coding is. It's more about collaboration, which seems to be why we're learning git and github right off the bat

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

 I am really excited to continue creating projects. I think that's what originally drew me to this program. We will learn to create so many beautiful and creative things with what we're learning. When we get the knowledge from this program, I think the possibilities will be close to limitless

## **What is something about you that can only be learned from reading this blog?**

 I was a professional soccer player in Brazil right after graduating high school, I have been trying to find my "thing" ever since. I have owned a gas station, been a real estate agent, been a mailman, I have done day trading, DoorDash, and so many other jobs/careers. I've loved what I have learned along the way but nothing quite fit. I believe this program will set me up to find my future

# **Week 2**

## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

 After this week I learned how fun it is to design your site with css. I also learned I don't know much about functionality. I am very much looking forward to learning more about javascript and the functions that it can make.

## What are you struggling with?

 I think my biggest struggle so far is that I really don't know much and I have so much to learn. Learning is something that I enjoy so I would say it's not so much a struggle just a reality of where I am currently.

## How do you solve a problem?

 I definitely learn best by doing. So for example with this last project I took what I had learned in the slides and tried to add to it by just trying things. I would see what worked and what didn't and go from there. To quote from my project this week and the golfer Sam Sneade **"practice puts brains in your muscles"**. I also of course use google and youtube to find different ways to do what I am trying to do. I have also been making folders with everyone's projects, seeing what they did and trying to apply it to my projects.

## What methods do you use to help get yourself unstuck?

 I just keep going. I look up things on google and youtube or I look at sites that are already out there with devtools and see what they did with their designs/code. I am staying away from AI for this stuff as much as I can. I used copilot this week to help make my logo and that was it.

# **Week 3**

## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?

 HTML provides the skeleton which can then build upon. CSS is the styler that we can use to make our page have color, text changes, margin, padding, to make the application look the way we would like. JavaScript is the functionality of the page. I have a ton to continue learning about JavaScript. There is so much you can do. Its amazing.

## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

 My blog contains objects including:
  I have not yet incorporated any javascript into my blog. I have been moving this week which has severely lessened my time. Now that I am all moved in I plan to dedicate some time to working on incorporating more style and some javascript into my blog.

# **Week 4**

## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

I really enjoy working from home. It's great being able to work on things at your own pace/time. However, I am looking forward to really buckling down in person and getting to work.

## What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

The biggest hinderance would have to be that I moved during onboarding. It basically took two days away from what I was learning. I think I made up for it but I really don't like feeling like I am behind.

## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

I think the way I overcame challenges during onboarding is how I overcome any challenge. Hard work and patience. I truly believe that with those two things, plus some confidence in yourself, you can do anything.
