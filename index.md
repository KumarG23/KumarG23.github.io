## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

 When I first signed up for the class I knew absolute zero about coding. In my mind I saw myself in a dark room typing code all day. But i'm realizing that's not really what coding is. It's more about collaboration, which seems to be why we're learning git and github right off the bat

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

 I am really excited to continue creating projects. I think that's what originally drew me to this program. We will learn to create so many beautiful and creative things with what we're learning. When we get the knowledge from this program, I think the possibilities will be close to limitless

## **What is something about you that can only be learned from reading this blog?**

 I was a professional soccer player in Brazil right after graduating high school, I have been trying to find my "thing" ever since. I have owned a gas station, been a real estate agent, been a mailman, I have done day trading, doordash, and so many other jobs/careers. I've loved what I have learned along the way but nothing quite fit. I believe this program will set me up to find my future

## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

 After this week I learned how fun it is to design your site with css. I also learned I dont know much about functionality. I am very much looking forward to learning more about javascript and the funtions that it can make.

## What are you struggling with?

 I think my biggest struggle so far is that I really dont know much and I have so much to learn. Learning is something that I enjoy so I would say it's not so much a struggle just a reality of where I am currently.

## How do you solve a problem?

 I definitely learn best by doing. So for example with this last project I took what I had learned in the slides and tried to add to it by just trying things. I would see what worked and what didnt and go from there. To quote from my project this week and the golfer Sam Sneade **"practice puts brains in your muscles"**. I also of course use google and youtube to find different ways to do what I am tryin to do. I have also been making folders with everyones projects, seeing what they did and trying to apply it to my projects. 

## What methods do you use to help get yourself unstuck?

 I just keep going. I look up things on google and youtube or I look at sites that are already out there with devtools and see what they did with their designs/code. I am staying away from AI for this stuff as much as I can. I used copilot this week to help make my logo and that was it.
