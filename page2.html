    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">After this week I learned how fun it is to design your site with css. I also learned I don't know much about functionality. I am very much looking forward to learning more about javascript and the functions that it can make.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What are you struggling with?
    </u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I think my biggest struggle so far is that I really don't know much and I have so much to learn. Learning is something that I enjoy so I would say it's not so much a struggle just a reality of where I am currently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>How do you solve a problem?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I definitely learn best by doing. So for example with this last project I took what I had learned in the slides and tried to add to it by just trying things. I would see what worked and what didn't and go from there. To quote from my project this week and the golfer Sam Sneade **"practice puts brains in your muscles"**. I also of course use google and youtube to find different ways to do what I am trying to do. I have also been making folders with everyone's projects, seeing what they did and trying to apply it to my projects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What methods do you use to help get yourself unstuck?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I just keep going. I look up things on google and youtube or I look at sites that are already out there with devtools and see what they did with their designs/code. I am staying away from AI for this stuff as much as I can. I used copilot this week to help make my logo and that was it.</p>
