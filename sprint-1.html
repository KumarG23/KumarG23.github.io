    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">Definitely ask more questions. I need to use the teachers as a resource more. They really don't mind helping. I like to figure things out on my own if I can but I need to not spin my wheels too long.</p>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic px-5"><u>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
    </u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">The atomic design thing makes a lot of sense to me. I should implement that more. I want to learn more JavaScript. There is a lot to it but it is extremely useful and there is so much you can do with it.</p>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What is your “Why”?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I want to learn new things. I want to be a good role model and provider for my son. I want to make more cool things.</p>
