    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I really enjoy working from home. It's great being able to work on things at your own pace/time. However, I am looking forward to really buckling down in person and getting to work.</p>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
    </u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">The biggest hinderance would have to be that I moved during onboarding. It basically took two days away from what I was learning. I think I made up for it but I really don't like feeling like I am behind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I think the way I overcame challenges during onboarding is how I overcome any challenge. Hard work and patience. I truly believe that with those two things, plus some confidence in yourself, you can do anything.</p>
