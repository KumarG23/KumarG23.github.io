    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">When I first signed up for the class I knew absolute zero about coding. In my mind I saw myself in a dark room typing code all day. But i'm realizing that's not really what coding is. It's more about collaboration, which seems to be why we're learning git and github right off the bat</p>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I am really excited to continue creating projects. I think that's what originally drew me to this program. We will learn to create so many beautiful and creative things with what we're learning. When we get the knowledge from this program, I think the possibilities will be close to limitless</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What is something about you that can only be learned from reading this blog?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I was a professional soccer player in Brazil right after graduating high school, I have been trying to find my "thing" ever since. I have owned a gas station, been a real estate agent, been a mailman, I have done day trading, DoorDash, and so many other jobs/careers. I've loved what I have learned along the way but nothing quite fit. I believe this program will set me up to find my future</p>
