                        <p id="par">I am an aspiring full stack software engineer. Just a few months ago I decided to take the plunge and learn about software development in a high intensity bootcamp. So far I am loving making cool things on the computer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                             I love my family above anything else. My hobbies include reading, playing video games, playing and watching sports, and cooking.</p>

                            2010 - Professional Soccer Player
                            <p id="par">I played soccer at a professional level in Curitiba Brazil for a team called Real Brasil. I loved every minute of my time there and made connections that have continued since then. This experience showed me a completely different world than what I had become accustomed to. It taught me teamwork on a whole new level. It showed me how hard work can really change your life. We trained at least twice a day sometimes three times. We also had technical practices where we would go over video and break down what we did right and wrong. It was a great learning experience that I will never forget.</p>

                            <p id="par">I owned a small gas station/restaurant/pool hall for over 3 years. This experience was incredible. I learned the inner workings of a business. I learned the hard work and just pure hours that many business owners have to put in to find their success. I had not had any experience running a business prior to this. It was so much to learn but I am very glad I did it. I learned payroll, hiring, sales, pricing, customer service, worked with vendors, and so many more things that the list would be endless. Huge learning experience for me overall.</p>

                            2016 Soccer Coach
                            <p id="par">I was a soccer coach for Commonwealth Soccer Club for 5 years. This experience was one of the greatest joys of my life. Seeing the kids I coached improve and grow right before my eyes was incredible. I learned about mentoring young players, practice curriculum, and scheduling with parents/coaches/referees/managers and so much more. I hope to one day return to coaching. I have a "D" license already and would like to keep going up the ladder.</p>
