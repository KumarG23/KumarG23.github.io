    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic px-5"><u>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">As far as I understand it HTML is the skeleton from which we build on, CSS is for styling, and JavaScript is for functionality. We combine them all to create magic.</p>

    <div class="text-center fs-4 fst-italic"><u>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</u>
        <p class="d-flex p-5">I don't believe I have incorporated any objects into this blog yet. I definitely plan to change that soon. I have been moving this week which hindered my time with doing much extra. I plan to start fresh next week and get to work even harder to make up for it. JavaScript seems like it opens up a ton of doors and I can't wait to learn more.</p>
